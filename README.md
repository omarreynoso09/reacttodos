Instructor} Introduce child/parent component relationship, controlled inputs

- Create a new github repo called reacttodos, clone the repo to your computer and add the link to populi.
- Run "npx create-react-app ." inside /reacttodos.
- Create a new component <ToDoComponent /> in app.js and add it to the <App> component as a child component:
- <div className="App">
  <header className="App-header">
  <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
  <ToDoComponent />
  </header>
  </div>
- In ToDoComponent, implement the following functionality:
- There should be two text input fields, one dropdown input field (Hint: use <select> and <option>), and a button.
- Every input field should store its current value in a useState variable. The input field should also receive its current value from the variable in useState, i.e. it should be a controlled component:
- <input type="text" value={title} onChange={(event)=>{
  const newTitle = event.target.value
  setTitle(title)
  }}>
- The first text input field should set a state variable called title.
- The second text input field should set a state variable called description.
- The dropdown field should have 3 values "low", "medium" and "high" and should set a state variable called importance.
- The button should say submit and onClick, it should push a new object into a state variable called toDoList with the current values inputted by the user. E.G. If I type a title of "New Todo", a description of "My new todo", select an importance of "medium", and press submit, the state variable toDoList should look like this:
- [{
  title: "New Todo",
  description: "My new Todo",
  importance: "medium"
  }]
- Finally, render the list of todo's stored in toDoList to the page.
